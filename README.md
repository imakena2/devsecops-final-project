## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a secure deployment pipeline for a web application using modern DevSecOps practices. The final goal is to deliver a fully automated, monitored, and secure CI/CD deployment flow using container orchestration and security testing tools.

> 🔧 **Note:** This project is being developed incrementally. Currently, **Step 1 (Node.js app)** and **Step 2 (SSL + headers via NGINX)** have been implemented. Other components will be added in the coming weeks.
